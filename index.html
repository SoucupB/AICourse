                  Artificial Intelligence is the hot topic for the past 5 years in artificial intelligence with its breakthrough in
                  image, voice recognition and a lot of other subjects such as game Bots development. As it is now a lot of programmers, begginers or advanced are starting
                  to get into this subject because its very COOL. Ofcourse, when we think about artificial intelligence we generally think about <span style="color:Green;">Neural Networks</span> and
                  <span style="color:rgb(87, 0, 128);">Python</span> since it is an easy scripting language.Unfortunatelly there are some obstacles in the learning process
                  of this topic because installing and using the existing librarys its not quite for begginers and some of the potential AI creators will drop this topic
                  before they could even begin.

              <p class="lead">
                  Today I come up with a solution that should solve the problem of getting into this subject more easily with this 'light' library specifically designed
                  for the purpose of learning and also for the development of small applications using the Neural Network.
                  But what does light means? well it means that the library can be installed very easily with just one command and can be used to solve easy as well as hard problems.
              </p>
              <h1>Examples</h1>
              <p class="lead">
                  There are 2 problems which are mandatory for every machine learning engineer. This problems are the XOR problem where the structure should
                  learn how to mimic the XOR binary function(The hello world for machine learning!) and the digits recognition problem which is training a neural Network
                  to recognize handwritten digits.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <p class="lead">
                Here is the code for digits training the digits recognition algorithm.

                <code class="python">
import NeuralNetwork as nn #import the library
import FileReader as fr
images = fr.GetImageData() #get mnist data which are just the digits images formatted to binary
labels = fr.GetLabels() #get the labels for each image

imageWidth = 28
epochs = 20
net = nn.NeuralNetwork([imageHeight * imageWidth, 51, 10], 0.2, [nn.RELU, nn.SIGMOID])

    print(i, net.sgdLong(images[:(50 * (i + 1))], labels[:(50 * (i + 1))], 10, nn.OPT_SGD))

              <p class="lead">
                  Before you decide to actually get the library, maybe its better to test it before taking any action.
                  In this section you can test the library with different problems.
